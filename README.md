# Castel_War_Pygame
### Castle War
Castel War , created by Giacomo Colosio and Mattia Moro is a video game
generated with the python computer language. Specifically based on the use of
the Pygame library that allows the creation of games.

### Why a strategy game?
The idea of the game that we wanted to follow is clear, aware that other
languages allow better video game creations we wanted to make it as
entertaining as possible basing the game not only on the graphical aspect but
also and above all on the strategic aspect.

### Context
The game is about an invented
medieval battle between the
kingdom of Bergamo and the
kingdom of Lecco, two of the
poorest kingdoms of the time so
much so that they consisted of
only a tower, a castle and a mine.
Who will prevail?
